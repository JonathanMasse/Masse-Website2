  <p>Embedded Systems Final Project:
  <br>A war game that is played between two players. One on a FPGA board and one on a webpage. The users will be able to sign in and know their win loss ratio.</p>
  <p>Tron Game:
  <br>Designed a tron game in VHDL. The game was based off the movie tron.
  In the game the player plays against an AI that can change the difficulty for different game experinces.</p>

  <p>Summer 2018 Internship AR Assisted Router:
  <br>Worked in Unity to create and augmented reality assisted router program. 
  The program created a virtual plan that was overlayed on any flat surface. 
  Then the user could choose a shape and place it onto the surface and see a virtual router cut it out.</p>
